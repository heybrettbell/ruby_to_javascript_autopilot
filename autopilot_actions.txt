# Call add_one_car_per_day with empty array and 10 days
# add_one_car_per_day loops through number of days (10)
# new_car equals get_new_car (10 cars, Toronto, etc, zero passengers)
# Run add_car method, which puts a new car into the cars array and posts confirmation and size of fleet
# Calls command_fleet method, which runs act method
# act method checks distance between cites, gas level, num of passengers
# if gas is lower than 20, they run fill_up_gas method
# fill_up_gas method replaces old gas level to 100 and displays message
# If passengers are less than 3 run pick_up_passenger method
# pick_up_passenger method adds one passenger to count, drops gas by 10, displays message
# if gas is less than distance_between_cities, fill up, posts message
# Sets previous_passengers to passengers in car, then resets to zero and posts message
# Iterates through next loop, repeating number of times passed in add_one_car_per_day method
